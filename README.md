This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key sales performance metrics, including:
✅ Total revenue and profit trends over time
✅ Top-performing products and regions
✅ Customer segmentation and purchasing behavior
✅ Monthly and quarterly sales comparisons

My goal with this project was to create a dynamic and interactive tool that enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions with ease. Through the use of Power BI’s DAX functions, data modeling, and visual storytelling, I was able to bring complex datasets to life in a clear and meaningful way.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
🔹 Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
🔹 Building data models and creating DAX measures
🔹 Designing intuitive and user-friendly dashboards
🔹 Communicating insights visually for better business understanding

I truly believe that data visualization is more than just charts — it’s about telling the story behind the numbers.

I’d love to hear your feedback and suggestions! 🙌
